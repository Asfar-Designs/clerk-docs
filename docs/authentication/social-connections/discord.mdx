  - Use Discord to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [**Discord**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Discord account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. Navigate to the [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Discord account. This guide walks you through this process.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [**Discord Developers**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Discord as a social connection in Clerk

  1. Navigate to the [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorized redirect URI** somewhere secure.
  1. Keep the modal and page open throughout the guide.

  ### Create a Discord Developer application

  1. On a separate page, go to the [**Discord Developers**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page and sign in to create a new Discord application.
  1. In the top-right, select **New Application**.
  1. Fill in the required fields and select **Create**. You will be redirected to the **General Information** page.
  1. In the sidebar, select **OAuth2**.
  1. Under **Redirects**, select **Add Redirect**. Add the **Authorized Redirect URI** that you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Select **Save Changes** (you might have to touch anywhere on the screen for the button to appear).
  1. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In your Discord Developers dashboard, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. If you don't see the **Copy** button under the **Client Secret**, select **Reset Secret** to generate a new one.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard** where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Select the **Discord** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth setup is by visiting your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available out-of-the-box for all Clerk applications.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of your **Clerk Dashboard**, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - **For development**: `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production**: `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Discord** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Discord account.

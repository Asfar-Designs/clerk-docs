Enabling OAuth with [**Discord**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Discord account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Discord account. This guide walks you through this process.

## Configuring Discord social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth Discord app at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Set a name for your new application and click create. Now that your application has been created, from the left side panel click on **OAuth2**, this is where you also need to add your **Redirect URL.**

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Discord. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect** input and save the changes.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

## Finished ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations! Your users can now sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Discord account.

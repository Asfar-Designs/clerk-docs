Enabling OAuth with [**Discord**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Discord account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [SSO Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections)**.
1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, search for **Discord**, then select **Discord** from the list.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Discord account. This guide walks you through this process.

To make the setup process easier, we recommend keeping two browser tabs open: one for your [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [**Discord Developers**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Discord as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [SSO Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections)**.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, search for **Discord**, then select **Discord** from the list.
  1. The configuration options will appear below. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are enabled.
  1. Copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep the modal and page open throughout the guide.

  ### Create a Discord Developer application

  1. On a separate page, go to the [**Discord Developers**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page and sign in to create a new Discord application.
  1. Once signed in, select **New Application** on the dashboard page.
  1. Enter a name for your new application and select **Create**.
  1. After being redirected to the **General Information** page, select **OAuth2** from the sidebar.
  1. For **Redirects**, paste the URL you copied from the Discord modal in your **Clerk Dashboard**. Select **Save Changes**.
  1. In the next section, you will connect Discord to Clerk using your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Keep this page open for the next step.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In your Discord application's **OAuth2** page, copy the **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard** page. In the **Add connection for all users** modal under the **Configure Discord**, paste the string in **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to your Discord application's **OAuth2** page. Select  **Copy** under **Client Secret**. If you do not see the **Copy** button, select **Reset Secret** to generate a new one. Be sure to copy the string as it will not be shown again.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard** page. Paste the string in **Client Secret** and select **Add connection**. Once the configurations are saved, you should see a green **`Used for sign-in`** label next to Discord in the **Provider** list.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth setup is by visiting your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available out-of-the-box for all Clerk applications.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of your **Clerk Dashboard**, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - **For development**: `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production**: `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Discord** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Discord account.
</Steps>

### Finished ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations! Your users can now sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Discord account.

Enabling OAuth with [**Discord**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Discord account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Discord account and a Discord OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Configure for your development instance

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for _development instances_ - no other configuration is needed. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard and go to **User & Authentication -> [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. In the list of **Auth Providers**, enable Discord and select **Save**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must generate your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Discord account. This guide walks you through this process.

## Configuring Discord social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth Discord app at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

![Creating an OAuth Discord app](/docs/images/authentication-providers/discord/79076b03d80901a41644b8956ec42b4620d9a6c4-1920x838.png)

Set a name for your new application and click create. Now that your application has been created, from the left side panel click on **OAuth2**, this is where you also need to add your **Redirect URL.**

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Discord. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect** input and save the changes.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

![Obtaining the Client ID and Client secret](/docs/images/authentication-providers/discord/a3d2039c311633627cb39887f74d18d374669658-1920x841.png)

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Discord is now configured for your instance.

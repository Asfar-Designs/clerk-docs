Enabling OAuth with [**GitHub**](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) allows your users to sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their GitHub account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, search for **GitHub**, then select **GitHub** from the list.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your GitHub account. This guide walks you through this process.

To make the setup process easier, we recommend keeping two browser tabs open: one for your [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [**GitHub Developers**](https://GitHub.com/developers/applications) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable GitHub as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [SSO Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections)**.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, search for **GitHub**, then select **GitHub** from the list.
  1. The configuration options will appear below. Enable **Use custom credentials**. Keep the modal and page open throughout the guide.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. On a separate page, go to [**GitHub's Developer Settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps) by selecting your profile photo in the top-right navigation, then choose **Settings**. In the sidebar, select **Developer settings**.
  1. In the sidebar, select **OAuth Apps** then select [**New OAuth app**](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
  1. After being redirected to the **Register a new OAuth app** form, enter your **Application name** and **Homepage URL**. Keep the page open for the next step.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard**. In the **Add connection for all users** modal under the **Configure GitHub**, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**.
  1. Navigate back to **GitHub** and paste the string in **Authorization callback URL**.
  1. Select **Register application**.
  1. After your application is created successfully, select your **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard**. Paste the string in **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to **GitHub**. Select **Generate a new client secret**. Copy the **Client secret**.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard**. Paste the string in **Client secret**.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth setup is by visiting your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available out-of-the-box for all Clerk applications.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of your **Clerk Dashboard**, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - **For development**: `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production**: `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **GitHub** as an option. Use it to sign in with your GitHub account.

  - Use Spotify to authenticate users with OAuth.
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) allows your users to sign in and sign up to your Clerk application with their Spotify account.

## Overview

**Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Spotify on development instances.** You will have to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Spotify Developer account. This guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the Spotify application's allowlist to connect to your Clerk application via Spotify OAuth. Each user attempting to use your Clerk application in **development** with Spotify as their authentication method must be added to the allowlist before gaining access.
>
> _Although users may be able to log into your **development** Clerk application without being allowlisted in Spotify, any API requests made with an access token associated with that user and the Spotify app will receive a 403 status code._

<Steps>
  ### Create a Spotify application

  1. To create a new OAuth Spotify app, go to the [Spotify Developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/) and sign in.
  1. Once signed in, select your profile button in the top right nav and select the Dashboard link from the dropdown menu. Select either one of the two [**Create app**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create) buttons in the dashboard page.
  1. Once redirected to the application creation form, complete the fields for **App name**, **App description**, and **Redirect URIs**.

  ### Spotify + your Clerk app

  You can retrieve the **Redirect URI** from the Clerk Dashboard. But first, you need to enable Spotify as a social connection for your Clerk application.

  In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. From the list of OAuth vendors, toggle on the Spotify option.

  In the modal that opened, copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Configure Spotify application

  Navigate back to your Spotify app and paste the **Authorized redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Redirect URIs** input.

  Agree to Spotify's terms and conditions and click **Save**.

  Once your Spotify app is created, you'll be redirected to the app dashboard. From there, navigate to **Settings**.

  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. Click on the settings cog icon next to the Spotify option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Finished ðŸŽ‰

  Congratulations! Social connection with Spotify is now configured for your Clerk application.

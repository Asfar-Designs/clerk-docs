Enabling OAuth with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) allows your users to sign in and sign up for your Clerk application with their Spotify account.

**Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Spotify on development instances.** You need to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which involves generating a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the Spotify Developer Dashboard. This guide walks you through this process.

> [!CAUTION]
> [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the Spotify application's allowlist to connect to your Clerk application via Spotify OAuth. Each user attempting to use your Clerk application in **development** with Spotify as their authentication method must be added to the allowlist before gaining access.
>
> Although users may be able to log into your **development** Clerk application without being allowlisted in Spotify, any API requests made with an access token associated with that user and the Spotify application will receive a 403 status code.

To make the setup process easier, we recommend keeping two browser tabs open: one for the [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) and one for the [**Spotify Developer Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Spotify as a social connection in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**.
  1. In the **Auth Providers** list, enable the **Spotify** option.
  1. In the modal that opens, copy the **Redirect URIs**. Keep the modal and page open throughout the guide.

  ### Create your application in the Spotify Developer Dashboard

  1. On a separate page, go to the [**Spotify Developer Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/) and sign in to create a new Spotify application.
  1. Once signed in, select your profile button in the top-right navigation and choose **Dashboard** from the dropdown menu. Select the [**Create app**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create) button on the dashboard page.
  1. After being redirected to the application creation form, complete the fields for **App name** and **App description**. For the **Redirect URIs** field, paste the URL you copied from the Spotify modal in the [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections).
  1. In the next section, you will connect Spotify to Clerk using your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. For now, select the **Settings** button. Keep this page open for the next step.

  ### Configure your Spotify connection in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the Spotify application's settings page, scroll to the bottom and select the **Edit** button.
  1. Scroll back to the top of the page and copy the **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to the **Clerk Dashboard** page. In the Spotify connection modal, paste the string in the **Client ID** field.
  1. Navigate back to the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Select the **View client secret** link and copy the string.
  1. Paste the string in the **Client secret** field. Select the **Save** button. After saving the changes, you should see a `Used for sign-in` label next to Spotify in the **Auth Providers** list.
</Steps>
